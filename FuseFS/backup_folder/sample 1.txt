Number theory is the most ancient mathematics, the purest of an important branch of mathematics, mathematics prince 
Gauss once said, mathematics is the queen of science, number theory is the queen of mathematics. The main task of number 
theory is to study the nature of integers, because the nature of integers is complex and profound, difficult to consider, so 
number theory has long been considered a beautiful mathematical discipline. And number theory is not only a pure 
mathematical subject, but also a subject with strong application. Nowadays, with the rapid development of modern 
computer network communication, number theory is widely and deeply applied in cryptography.
